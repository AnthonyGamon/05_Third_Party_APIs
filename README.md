# 05-Third-Party-APIs

With this homework I was needed to make a day calendar that is editable. With the calendar as time goes the different time blocks will change colors depending on if it is past, present or future. 

All of the fields are editable to add whatever you're doing that day. Then save and it should save to local storage.
